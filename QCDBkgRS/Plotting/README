 * log in to naf
If necessary:
 * load module use -a /afs/desy.de/group/cms/modulefiles/
 * export SCRAM_ARCH=slc6_amd64_gcc491

load modules:
 * module load root
 * module load pod
When this fails, you may have problems with a ROOT version. Log out and log in again, reload these modules

start the POD server: 
 * pod-server start
 * pod-submit -n 80 -r ge

wait, check how many servers are running with:
 * pod-info -n

when enough have started change to cmsenv root (needed for the proof to function with this trees)
 * cmsenv (in environment)
run root:
 * root -l MakePrediction.C
 * root -l MakeExpectation.C
Now you look at the output files:
 * root -l Expectation.root Prediction.root Compare.root
